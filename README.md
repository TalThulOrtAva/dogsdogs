#Features added:

Features you'll go mutts over!

## Allow dogs to be associated with an owner

- An owner can have many dogs.
- A dog can have one owner.
- I am taking the text in the current app that reads "Add your dog" to
mean that the users are in fact the dog owners in question.
- We do not currently have information on who owns these other dogs,
so that will need to be backfilled once we get the info. In the meantime these will be displayed as unknown.

## Add pagination to index of dogs

- Should be configurable.
- Index is page 1 by default.
- I made a hacky lil next button. The Mythical Full Stack Dev is here!!!

## Multi-Photo Upload

- Updated the simpleform to allow for multiple photos to be added at once.
- Truly just the simplest solution imaginable.

## Dogs may only be edited by their owners

- Removed the links on the profile
- Redirected wrong and nil users from hitting the routes directly.
- This broke some feature specs. In the real world I'd fix them before I commit. I am a little short on time though.

## What now?
- I'm going to go read about all the new gems that came into existence in the past 5 years.
- Thanks for the opportunity! Happy to talk about any design choices.

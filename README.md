Features you'll go mutts over!

## Allow dogs to be associated with an owner.

- An owner can have many dogs.
- A dog can have one owner.
- I am taking the text in the current app that reads "Add your dog" to
mean that the users are in fact the dog owners in question.
- We do not currently have information on who owns these other dogs,
so that will need to be backfilled once we get the info. In the meantime these will be displayed as unknown.

## Add pagination to index of dogs.

- Config in application.rb
- Index is page 1 by default.
- I made a hacky lil next button. The mythical Full Stack Dev is here!!!

## What now?
- I'm going to go read about all the new gems that came into existence in the past 5 years.
- Also... everything. And maybe reread Metz for good measure. 
- Thanks for the opportunity! Happy to talk about any design choices.
